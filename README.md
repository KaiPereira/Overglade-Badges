These are the (UNFINISHED) hackathon badges for Hackclub Overglade, a game jam within a game that's going to be happening in Singapore! They function as devboards, but also as badges with NFC tap, and e-inks!

## Custom Features
- Passive NFC tap for whatever your heart desires
- E-ink support so that you don't need any battery
- 20 GPIO's broken out onto header pins for programming
- Active NFC mode if you want to do some more complicated stuff

- RP2040 SoC with 4MB flash memory
- Cool PCB and exposed copper art (TBD)
